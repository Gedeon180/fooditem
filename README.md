Homework #3 Javascript Objects
The program asks user for what food they ate, the quantity, and the calories per item and displays the user input and shows the total number of calories the user will have entered.



I create a constructor object that takes 3 parameters (foodtype, quantity, and objects)
I create an object from this constructor that takes these three parameters and returns what the person ate and also the total number of calories after each time someone clicks the main button.
Each new object created based on the user's input is stored in an array that i created
I use two different js files to better manage my code.
